# Data science methods within geoinformatics
As a part of the Data science methods within geoinformatics, my colleague and I collaborated on evaluating a Location extraction model built using a natural language processing workflow. 
The central idea of our work was built on assessing the performance of a Location extraction task using Spacy (and FS_score to properly account for class imbalance).
